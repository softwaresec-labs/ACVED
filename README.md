# Android Vulnerability Early Detection (ACVED)

Android applications are rapidly published and updated due to continuous and increasing user demands, and rapidly changing user needs. 
Due to the rushed development cycles, you may focus more on the applications' functionalities than the security and source code vulnerabilities. 
This may due to the lack of automated mechanisms to assist app developers in mitigating the vulnerabilities. 

This AI-powered Android Code Vulnerability Early Detection (ACVED) plugin can be integrated with the Android Studio to support you for real-time source code vulnerability mitigation. 
The plugin can provide the vulnerability status of a given source code line, which you are currently working on. 
A well-trained, highly accurate and efficient ensemble learning model runs in the backend of ACVED. It can detect source code vulnerabilities, and their CWE categories with 95% accuracy. 
Explainable AI techniques are also employed to provide the source code vulnerability prediction probabilities of each word. 
The model also receives regular updates with new training data from the LVDAndro dataset. 
Therefore, novel vulnerabilities can also be detected using the ACVED plugin.

Use ACVED User Guide for all the necessary instructions related to the ACVED plugin installation and usage.
